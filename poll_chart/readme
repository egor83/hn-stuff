Questions:

Q: - what would be the good (unit)tests for this program?
Q: - is there a way to use str.format in Py 2.5 (smth like import from future?)

TODO:


LATER/?:

- for fetching error add 'repeat' link to error page;
- track voting progress over time;
- store something for non-poll pages as well to prevent further fetches;
________________________________________________________________________________

DONE:

- store stripped title;
- count percentages;
- make a proper results page (simple template);
- see todos in the code
- on DownloadError fetch cached (if outdated) page;
IRR - fix long line problems: replace one of the spaces w/ newline (see 2595605, 2910571); - find the space closest to position 25 (from the left) and replace it with newline; (no multiline for pie)
- introduction page: examples, link to HNsearch: [poll]; plug; link to source + request for comments; link to other pages (?);
- log a warning on not a poll/other problems, don't fail silently;
- put parsing-related stuff to a separate file;
- handle addresses both w/ and w/o final slash;
- add statcounter;
- make base template;
- show total # of answers;
- improve error handling: display error cause to the user (custom exceptions?);
- only display the first 40 characters of each option description to make bar charts look better when there are long descriptions;

Questions (answered):

Q: - how do I catch the end of the poll?
A: - sibling will be None

Q: - how do I separate post w/a poll from the one without? Is there a reliable way to tell one from another?
A1: - votes have 'point(s)' with them, comments (atm) do not;
A2: - maybe there'd be something in HN serverside code;
